# sample-nextjs-app

Customer portal for the sample team's orders

Next.js 14 application (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. The health endpoint is at `/api/health`.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` starts the development server
- `npm run build` builds for production
- `npm run start` serves the production build
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint
- `npm run format:check` checks formatting with Prettier (`npm run format` fixes it)
- `npm test` runs the Jest unit tests
- `npm run test:e2e` runs the Playwright end-to-end tests (`npx playwright install chromium` once)

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/nextjs.yaml` lints, tests, builds and runs the end-to-end
tests on every push and pull request to `main`.
`.github/workflows/docker.yaml` builds the image, starts it, calls the health
endpoint and, on `main`, publishes it to
`ghcr.io/example-org/sample-nextjs-app`.
