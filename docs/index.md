## Local development

Requires Node.js 22 and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example-org/sample-nextjs-app.git
cd sample-nextjs-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application is served at <http://localhost:3000>.

| Command                | Purpose                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run dev`          | Development server with hot reload               |
| `npm run build`        | Production build (also type-checks and lints)    |
| `npm run start`        | Serve the production build                       |
| `npm run lint`         | ESLint with the Next.js rules                    |
| `npm run format`       | Format with Prettier                             |
| `npm run format:check` | Check formatting without changing files          |
| `npm test`             | Jest unit tests                                  |
| `npm run test:e2e`     | Playwright tests against a running application   |

Before the first end-to-end run, install the browser with
`npx playwright install chromium`.

## Health endpoint

`GET /api/health` returns:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "service": "sample-nextjs-app",
  "environment": "development"
}
```

## Testing

- Unit tests live in `__tests__/` and run in Jest with React Testing Library.
  `npm run test:coverage` enforces 70% coverage.
- End-to-end tests live in `e2e/` and run in Playwright with Chromium. In CI
  they run against the production build.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/nextjs.yaml` runs on every push and pull request to `main`:

| Job             | What it does                                                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lint            | ESLint and Prettier                                             |
| Unit tests      | Jest with coverage                                              |
| Build and e2e   | `next build`, then Playwright against the production build      |
| Dependency scan | Trivy report of known vulnerabilities in `package-lock.json`    |

The dependency scan reports and does not fail the build. In a public
repository its results also appear in the repository's Security tab.

`.github/workflows/docker.yaml` runs on the same events:

| Job   | What it does                                                                     |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lint  | Hadolint on the `Dockerfile`, kubeconform on `k8s/`                              |
| Image | Builds the image, starts it, calls `/api/health`, scans it with Trivy            |

On pushes to `main` the image is published to the GitHub Container Registry
with the workflow's own token; no secret has to be configured.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t sample-nextjs-app .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 sample-nextjs-app
```

Published images:

```
ghcr.io/example-org/sample-nextjs-app:latest
ghcr.io/example-org/sample-nextjs-app:sha-<commit>
```

## Kubernetes

`k8s/` contains a Deployment (two replicas, liveness and readiness probes on
`/api/health`) and a ClusterIP Service on port 80.

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

The package is private by default. Either make it public in the package
settings or add an image pull secret to the Deployment.

## Environment variables

Variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are available in the browser; all
others are server-only. Put local values in `.env.local`, which is ignored by
Git.
